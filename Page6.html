  <h1>September 2019- Feburary 2020</h1>
  <p>I privately tutor students. I taught students of multiple levels, from SATs to GCSEs. I mainly helped with subjects such as Maths and the Sciences but this also varied to languages and humanities modules, broadening my own knowledge.</p>
  <p>I built on my previously developed mentoring experience and gained skills in one- on-one teaching and in how to engage and encourage students.</p>
