<h1>September 2018-June 2019</h1>
<p>
  During my first year of sixth form, I worked as a tutoring assistant at the school.</p>
  <p> I co-ordinate as part of a group of tutors to teach classrooms of children from all ages across a wide range of subjects.</p>
  <p>Here I built the foundations to my customer facing and team working skills. </p>
