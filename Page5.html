    <h1><strong>July 2019</strong></h1>
<p><ul>
As part of my school’s work experience initiative, I secured a short-term placement at the Berkley Homes Group.
<p> I assisted with several tasks around the office, these included:</p>
<li>Assisting the Accounting department, here I updated the billings and payroll costs for a smaller arm of the company. I gained valuable skills in data management and data entry, while further improving my excel knowledge.</li>
<li>I spent some of my time on the placement as an intern to one of the software developers at the company. I gained experience using Visio and built on my technical knowledge previously gained during my education.</li>
<li>Manning the office’s IT helpdesk. I was responsible for referring employees, in need of IT assistance, to relevant engineers. I also, managed the ticket logs, providing a daily audit trial of the issues and resolutions seen each day. By engaging with customers, I was able to develop my skills in a customer facing environment.</li>
